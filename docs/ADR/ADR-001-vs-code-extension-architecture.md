# ADR-001: VS Code Extension Architecture

**Status**: ✅ Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Decision Makers**: Architecture Lead Agent, Human Oversight  
**Stakeholders**: Development team, end users, VS Code extension ecosystem  

## Context

We need to select a platform and architecture for implementing an AI-powered multi-agent development system. The system requires:

1. **Local Development Environment Integration**: Direct access to developer workflows and tools
2. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Support for 6+ specialized AI agents working in parallel
3. **Human-Centric Interaction**: Seamless integration with developer decision-making processes
4. **Extensibility**: Ability to adapt to different project types and technologies
5. **Performance**: Real-time coordination without disrupting development workflow

Several platform options were considered:
- Standalone desktop application
- Web-based application with local agent runners
- IDE plugins (IntelliJ, Eclipse, Sublime Text)
- **VS Code extension with integrated agent system**
- Command-line tool with optional GUI

## Decision

**We will implement the multi-agent system as a VS Code extension with the following architecture:**

### **Core Architecture Components**

1. **Extension Host Process**: Main VS Code extension running in Node.js environment
2. **Agent Orchestration Engine**: Central coordination system for all AI agents
3. **WebView-based UI**: Native VS Code interface using webview panels
4. **Local Agent Processes**: Individual Node.js processes for each specialized agent
5. **IPC Communication**: Inter-process communication via WebSockets and message passing
6. **VS Code API Integration**: Direct access to workspace, git, terminal, and editor APIs

### **Technical Stack**

```typescript
// Extension Framework
Platform: VS Code Extension API
Language: TypeScript/Node.js
UI Framework: Webview + HTML/CSS/JavaScript
Build System: webpack/esbuild for extension bundling

// Agent System
Agent Runtime: Node.js child processes
Communication: WebSocket + JSON message protocol
AI Integration: Anthropic Claude API, Tavily API
State Management: SQLite for persistence
```

### **Integration Points**

- **Workspace Integration**: Direct file system access and manipulation
- **Git Integration**: Automated branch management and commit workflows
- **Terminal Integration**: Command execution and monitoring
- **Editor Integration**: Code insertion, refactoring, and navigation
- **Extension Ecosystem**: Compatibility with existing VS Code extensions

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Native Developer Experience**: Seamless integration with existing VS Code workflows
2. **Ecosystem Access**: Leverage existing VS Code extensions and APIs
3. **Platform Consistency**: Native VS Code UI patterns and behaviors
4. **Wide Adoption Potential**: VS Code's large user base and extension marketplace
5. **Development Velocity**: Rich extension APIs reduce implementation complexity
6. **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux automatically
7. **Performance**: Direct access to VS Code APIs without external communication overhead
8. **Git Integration**: Built-in Git extension compatibility for version control workflows

### Negative Consequences

1. **VS Code Dependency**: Tied to VS Code platform and its API stability
2. **Extension Limitations**: Constrained by VS Code extension security model
3. **Market Limitation**: Only available to VS Code users (though this is a large market)
4. **API Evolution Risk**: Must adapt to VS Code API changes and deprecations
5. **Distribution Complexity**: Extension marketplace approval and update processes
6. **Resource Constraints**: Limited by VS Code extension memory and CPU restrictions

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Standalone Desktop Application
- **Pros**: Complete control over UI/UX, no platform constraints, cross-IDE support
- **Cons**: Complex integration with development tools, requires custom Git/terminal integration, significant UI development overhead
- **Rejected because**: Would require recreating functionality that VS Code already provides excellently

### Option 2: Web-Based Application with Local Agents
- **Pros**: Cross-platform, modern web technologies, easy deployment
- **Cons**: Complex local integration, security challenges, requires separate installation and setup
- **Rejected because**: Poor integration with local development environment and Git workflows

### Option 3: IntelliJ Plugin + Multi-IDE Support
- **Pros**: Could support multiple IDEs, rich plugin ecosystems
- **Cons**: Multiple implementations required, complex maintenance, smaller combined user base
- **Rejected because**: Development overhead for multiple platforms without proportional benefits

### Option 4: Command-Line Tool with Optional GUI
- **Pros**: IDE-agnostic, lightweight, scriptable
- **Cons**: Poor user experience, limited visual feedback, complex integration
- **Rejected because**: Conflicts with human-centric interaction requirements

## Implementation Notes

└── out/                      # Compiled extension
```

### **Performance Considerations**
- Use worker threads for CPU-intensive agent operations
- Implement lazy loading for agent initialization
- Cache API responses and computed results
- Optimize WebView performance with virtual scrolling
- Monitor extension memory usage and implement cleanup

### **Security Considerations**
- Secure API key storage using VS Code secret storage
- Validate all user inputs and agent communications
- Implement rate limiting for external API calls
- Use Content Security Policy for WebView security
- Audit agent-generated code before execution

### **Development Phases**
1. **Phase 1**: Basic extension scaffold and VS Code integration
2. **Phase 2**: Agent orchestration engine and communication
3. **Phase 3**: Individual agent implementations
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced coordination and human interaction
