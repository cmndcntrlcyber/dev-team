```

### Communication Patterns

#### Agent-to-Agent Communication
- **NATS Messaging**: Real-time communication between agents
- **Task Dependencies**: Agents wait for prerequisite work
- **Shared Context**: Access to project state and decisions
- **Conflict Resolution**: Architecture Lead mediates disputes

#### Human-Agent Interaction
- **Decision Points**: Critical choices escalated to humans
- **Approval Workflows**: Quality gates requiring human sign-off
- **Feedback Integration**: Human feedback influences agent behavior
- **Override Capability**: Humans can modify agent decisions

## üìä Agent Performance Metrics

### Individual Agent Metrics
- **Task Success Rate**: Percentage of successfully completed tasks
- **Average Task Time**: Time to complete typical tasks
- **Error Rate**: Frequency of failed or rejected work
- **Quality Score**: Code quality and adherence to standards
- **Learning Rate**: Improvement over time

### Collaboration Metrics
- **Handoff Efficiency**: Time between agent task transitions
- **Conflict Resolution**: How quickly disputes are resolved
- **Dependency Management**: Success in managing task prerequisites
- **Communication Clarity**: Effectiveness of inter-agent messaging

## üéõÔ∏è Agent Configuration

### Global Settings (Applies to All Agents)
```json
{
  "anthropicApiKey": "your-claude-key",
  "maxConcurrentTasks": 3,
  "taskTimeout": 30000,
  "qualityThreshold": 0.8,
  "logLevel": "info"
}
```

### Agent-Specific Configuration
Each agent can be customized:

#### Skill Level Settings
- **Beginner**: Basic implementations, more conservative choices
- **Intermediate**: Balanced approach, moderate complexity
- **Expert**: Advanced patterns, cutting-edge technologies

#### Workload Management
- **Max Concurrent Tasks**: How many tasks an agent handles simultaneously
- **Priority Weighting**: Which types of tasks get priority
- **Timeout Settings**: How long to work on complex tasks
- **Retry Logic**: How to handle failed tasks

## üö¶ Quality Gates and Approval Points

### Automatic Quality Gates
- **Code Quality**: Static analysis scores above threshold
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum percentage of code tested
- **Security Scans**: No critical vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Response times within limits

### Human Approval Points
- **Architecture Decisions**: Technology stack and major design choices
- **Security Configurations**: Authentication and authorization setup
- **Deployment Plans**: Production deployment strategies
- **Third-party Integrations**: External service connections

## üìà Agent Scaling Strategies

### Horizontal Scaling
Add more instances of the same agent type:
```bash
# Scale frontend agents for high UI workload
docker-compose up --scale agent-frontend=3

# Scale QA agents for extensive testing
docker-compose up --scale agent-qa=2
```

### Load Balancing
Distribute tasks across agent instances:
- **Round Robin**: Equal distribution of tasks
- **Capability Based**: Route tasks by agent specialization
- **Load Aware**: Consider current agent workload
- **Performance Based**: Route to fastest available agent

### Resource Management
Control agent resource usage:
- **Memory Limits**: Prevent excessive memory consumption
- **CPU Limits**: Control processing power allocation
- **Network Limits**: Manage API call rates
- **Storage Limits**: Control file system usage
