## Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)

### Pattern: Too Many Dependencies
**Problem**: Created tasks with complex dependency chains that caused bottlenecks
**Impact**: Delayed project completion by 40%
**Solution**: Minimize dependencies, prefer parallel work
**Prevention**: Break tasks into smaller, independent chunks

### Pattern: Vague Requirements
**Problem**: Tasks lacked specific acceptance criteria
**Impact**: High revision rate (3-4 cycles per task)
**Solution**: Always include detailed requirements and examples
**Prevention**: Use checklist format for requirements

### Pattern: Missing Context
**Problem**: Didn't provide agents with existing codebase context
**Impact**: Generated incompatible code
**Solution**: Always reference existing patterns and conventions
**Prevention**: Include code examples and style guides

## Quick Reference: Task Breakdown Patterns

### Full-Stack Web App Pattern
```
1. Architecture: Overall design (1 task)
2. Backend: Database schema (1 task)
3. Backend: API endpoints (1-3 tasks, parallel)
4. Frontend: Component structure (1 task)
5. Frontend: UI components (2-5 tasks, parallel)
6. Frontend: API integration (1 task, depends on 3)
7. QA: Unit tests (1-2 tasks, depends on 3,5)
8. QA: Integration tests (1 task, depends on 6)
9. DevOps: Containerization (1 task, depends on 8)
10. DevOps: CI/CD pipeline (1 task, depends on 9)

Estimated Duration: 3-5 hours
Agent Distribution: Backend 40%, Frontend 40%, QA 15%, DevOps 5%
```

### REST API Pattern
```
1. Architecture: API design (1 task)
2. Backend: Database models (1 task)
3. Backend: Endpoint implementation (2-4 tasks, parallel)
4. Backend: Authentication (1 task)
5. Backend: API documentation (1 task, depends on 3,4)
6. QA: API tests (1-2 tasks, depends on 3,4)
7. QA: Security scan (1 task, depends on 6)
8. DevOps: Deployment (1 task, depends on 7)

Estimated Duration: 2-3 hours
Agent Distribution: Backend 60%, QA 30%, DevOps 10%
```

### MCP Server Pattern
```
1. MCP: Server scaffolding (1 task)
2. MCP: Tool implementations (2-5 tasks, parallel)
3. MCP: Resource providers (1-3 tasks, parallel)
4. Backend: External API integration (1-2 tasks, if needed)
5. QA: Tool testing (1-2 tasks, depends on 2,3)
6. DevOps: Deployment (1 task, depends on 5)

Estimated Duration: 1.5-3 hours
Agent Distribution: MCP 60%, QA 25%, DevOps 10%, Backend 5%
```

## Delegation Decision Examples

### ‚úÖ Good Delegations (Score 26+)

**Example 1**: "Build a full-stack e-commerce platform"
- Score: 85 (10 files √ó 3 + 8 components √ó 5 + 5 integrations √ó 4 + stack change)
- Result: Excellent use of agents, parallel work, 4 hour completion

**Example 2**: "Create MCP server for GitHub integration with 5 tools"
- Score: 45 (8 files √ó 3 + 5 components √ó 5)
- Result: MCP agent excelled, completed in 2 hours with high quality

### ‚ùå Poor Delegations (Score <11)

**Example 1**: "Fix typo in README"
- Score: 2 (1 file √ó 2)
- Issue: Delegation overhead not worth it, Cline faster

**Example 2**: "Update environment variable"
- Score: 2 (1 file √ó 2)
- Issue: Simple config change doesn't benefit from agents

### ü§î Borderline Cases (Score 11-25)

**Example 1**: "Add user authentication to existing app"
- Score: 22 (3 files √ó 2 + 2 components √ó 5 + 1 integration √ó 4)
- Decision: Ask user - delegation saves time but adds coordination overhead
- Recommendation: Delegate if unfamiliar with auth patterns

**Example 2**: "Create 3 React components with tests"
- Score: 18 (6 files √ó 3)
- Decision: Ask user - straightforward for Cline, but agents faster
- Recommendation: Handle directly if simple, delegate if complex state management

## Checkpoint Quality Patterns

### High-Success Checkpoints

**Pattern**: Detailed acceptance criteria in task description
```markdown
Task: Create login form component

Acceptance Criteria:
‚úì Email and password fields with validation
‚úì "Remember me" checkbox
‚úì "Forgot password" link
‚úì Form submission handler with loading state
‚úì Error message display
‚úì Accessibility: keyboard navigation, ARIA labels
‚úì Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
‚úì Unit tests with 80%+ coverage

Example:
[Provide mockup or reference design]
```
**Result**: 90% first-try success rate

### Low-Success Checkpoints

**Pattern**: Vague requirements
```markdown
Task: Create login form

Description: Add a login form to the app
```
**Result**: 40% first-try success rate, 3+ revisions typical

---

## Communication Patterns

### Effective Feedback Format

```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è Task Needs Revision: [Task Name]

Issues Found:
1. [Line 45] Missing null check before accessing user.email
2. [Component LoginForm] Form doesn't handle network errors
3. [Tests] Missing test for validation edge case

Requirements:
1. Add null/undefined checks for all user properties
2. Implement error boundary or try-catch for network failures
3. Add test case: "should show error when email is empty string"

Code Example (for requirement 1):
```typescript
const email = user?.email ?? '';
```

Expected Behavior:
Form should gracefully handle all error states and provide clear user feedback
```

**Result**: 85% resolution on first revision

---

## Performance Optimization Patterns

### Parallel Task Execution
**Strategy**: Create independent tasks that can run simultaneously
**Example**: Frontend components + Backend endpoints at same time
**Impact**: 50% reduction in total time

### Batch Task Creation
**Strategy**: Create all tasks at once rather than incrementally
**Example**: Define all 10 tasks upfront, not one at a time
**Impact**: Agents can optimize their work queue

### Minimal Dependencies
**Strategy**: Only link tasks that truly depend on each other
**Example**: Frontend doesn't need to wait for DevOps
**Impact**: Maximizes parallelization opportunities
