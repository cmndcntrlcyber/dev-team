## 📊 Integration Metrics

### Complexity Scoring System
```
Score = (Files to modify × 2) + 
        (Files to create × 3) + 
        (Components needed × 5) + 
        (Integration points × 4) + 
        (Stack changes × 10)

Decision Matrix:
- 0-10: Handle directly
- 11-25: Ask user preference  
- 26+: Delegate to dev-team
```

### Expected Performance
- **Simple tasks**: <1 minute (handled directly)
- **Medium tasks**: 2-5 minutes (delegation overhead)
- **Complex tasks**: 30 minutes - 5 hours (full delegation)
- **Quality score target**: ≥7/10
- **First-try success target**: ≥70%

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Direct Handling
```
User: "Fix typo in README"
Complexity: 2 points
Action: Cline handles directly
Time: <1 minute
```

### Example 2: Full Delegation
```
User: "Build a full-stack todo app with React and Express"
Complexity: 67 points
Action: Delegate to dev-team
Agents: Frontend, Backend, QA, DevOps
Time: ~3 hours
```

### Example 3: Borderline Case
```
User: "Add user authentication"
Complexity: 22 points
Action: Ask user preference
Options: Direct (faster) vs Delegated (leverages specialists)
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-key>  # For AI agents
SESSION_SECRET=<your-secret>  # For API security
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... # Configured automatically
```

### Docker Compose
- File: `docker-compose.simple.yml`
- Services: app (port 5000), postgres (port 5432)
- Auto-starts: Yes (via workflow)
- Health checks: Configured

## 🎓 Key Features

### For Cline (AI Assistant)
1. **Systematic approach** to task complexity analysis
2. **Clear delegation criteria** based on objective metrics
3. **Quality checkpoints** at every stage
4. **Learning system** that improves over time
5. **Complete API integration** for all operations
6. **Error recovery** procedures

### For Users (Developers)
1. **Transparent decision-making** - always informed why delegation happens
2. **Quality assurance** - all work verified before delivery
3. **Time savings** - complex tasks handled by specialized agents
4. **No setup required** - automatic initialization
5. **Flexibility** - can override delegation decisions
6. **Continuous improvement** - system learns from patterns

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Implemented
- ✅ No API keys in code
- ✅ Environment variable validation
- ✅ Input sanitization in API calls
- ✅ Secure defaults
- ✅ Error message sanitization

### Recommendations
- Keep `.env` file secure (not in git)
- Rotate API keys periodically
- Monitor API usage
- Review agent-generated code for security

## 🚧 Known Limitations

1. **App container shows unhealthy** - Currently showing unhealthy status but API is responding. May need health check tuning.
2. **No agents configured** - Agents are not pre-configured. Will need setup on first use.
3. **Manual approval may be needed** - Some operations require user confirmation
4. **Network dependency** - Requires localhost:5000 accessible
